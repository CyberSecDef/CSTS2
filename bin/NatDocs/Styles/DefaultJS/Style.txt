# This is a configuration file for a Natural Docs HTML output style.


# Inheritance
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can inherit the settings of another style like this:
#
# Inherit: [style]
#
# All of its settings will be applied before yours.  You can inherit more than
# one style.
#
# If you're building your own style from scratch, do not inherit anything.  If
# you just want to make some changes to the default style, inherit Default.
# If you're building your own page design from scratch but want to keep the
# default JavaScript functions, inherit DefaultJS.  This will include the code
# but not the CSS or images.


# Linked Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link: NDCore.js
Frame Link: NDFramePage.js
Frame Link: NDMenu.js
Frame Link: NDSummary.js
Frame Link: NDSearch.js
Content Link: NDContentPage.js


# You can link .css, .js, and .json files to the output like this:
#
# Link: [file]
# Frame Link: [file]
# Content Link: [file]
#
# These files will be included the generated output via link or script tags.
# If you do not specify a page type, it will be included in every page.
#
# While all files will be copied to the output folder automatically, they are
# not linked automatically.  Since JavaScript files can be loaded dynamically
# and CSS files can be imported from other ones, you must explicitly link the
# ones you want here.


# OnLoad
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

OnLoad: NDCore.AddIEClassesToBody();

Frame OnLoad: NDFramePage.Start();

Content OnLoad: NDContentPage.Start();


# You can add code to the page's OnLoad handler like this:
#
# OnLoad: [statement]
# Frame OnLoad: [statement]
# Content OnLoad: [statement]
#
# If you do not specify a page type, it will be called for every page.
#
# The OnLoad statement is confined to a single line.  It's recommended that
# you make your OnLoad code a function in a separate .js file, link that file
# from here, and then call it from this statement rather than trying to cram
# it on this line.
