Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Since the MDM server is a critical component of the mobility architecture and must be configured to only those ports, protocols, and services (PPS) necessary to support functionality, all others must be expressly disabled or removed. A firewall installed on the MDM server provides a protection mechanism to ensure unwanted service requests do not reach the MDM server and outbound traffic is limited to only MDM server functionality.
